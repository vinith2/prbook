This will be hard unless you believe in it and perhaps even like it.\n",

    "A much better result than what we initially obtained with random weights! Let's try to visualize the digits in a way that clearly shows that we've got ourselves some good weights. We need a way to represent the digits which live in a $28 \\times = 784$ dimensional space by points in the 2D plane. We will do it like this: choose two directions $\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{784}$ and then represent a digit $\\mathbf{x}$ by a point $(\\mathbf{e}_1^T \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{e}_2^T \\mathbf{x})$ in the plane. We'll choose $\\mathbf{e}_2 = \\mathbf{w} / \\| \\mathbf{w} \\|$ becase we're interested in what the distribution of points looks like along the direction of the weights. Then we'll set $\\mathbf{e}_1$ to some unit vector orthogonal to $\\mathbf{e}_2$. Since there are 783 orthogonal directions, we choose one at random. You can check that the computed vectors are indeed orthogonal."
